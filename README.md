# ShortcutSync-for-Playnite

Extension that synchronizes shortcuts for all games recognized by Playnite so that they can be found by other launchers, e.g. Windows Search.

Can be set up to update on startup, otherwise it reacts to changes in the database, or it can be triggered manually.

Uses the pieces of code from Playnite.Common to convert icons into .ico files and places it next to the original icon.
